# Diagnostic Debugger & Logging Architecture (`DEBUG.md`)

This document specifies the internal diagnostics logging system, ring buffer management, network request inspection, response body previews, and the AI troubleshooting prompt generator.

---

## 1. Objectives & Scope

To allow comprehensive debugging and telemetry analysis on both browser and Android native host environments without exposing sensitive network tokens, the application incorporates an in-memory diagnostic logging pipeline:
- **Ring Buffer Storage**: Bounded FIFO storage preventing memory leaks.
- **Network Interception Logging**: Captures outgoing/incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
- **15-Character Response Preview**: Sanitized body preview to quickly confirm data formats (e.g. `{"wireMagic":"pb...`).
- **AI Troubleshooting Prompt Generator**: One-click generation of formatted markdown problem reports tailored for AI coding assistants.

## 2. In-Memory Ring Buffer (`src/utils/logBuffer.ts`)

### 2.1 Specification
- **Capacity**: Fixed maximum entries (default: 250 records).
- **Log Entry Structure**:
  ```ts
  export interface DiagnosticLogEntry {
    id: string;
    timestamp: number;
    level: 'info' | 'warn' | 'error' | 'debug';
    tag: string;
    message: string;
    metadata?: Record<string, unknown>;
  }
  ```
- **Overflow Handling**: When capacity is exceeded, the oldest entry is evicted (`shift()`), preserving the most recent telemetry.

## 3. Network Request Inspection & 15-Character Preview

### 3.1 Network Event Captures
When the application dispatches subtitle requests (`/api/fetch-subtitles`, `/api/youtube-timedtext-translate`) or intercepts native WebView requests:
1. Records URL path, method, and query parameters.
2. Sanitizes headers (stripping cookies and auth tokens).
3. Reads the first 15 characters of the response body for instant signature verification:
   - YouTube JSON3 signature: `{"wireMagic":"pb`
   - XML TimedText signature: `<?xml version="`
   - SubRip signature: `1\n00:00:`

### 3.2 Security & Performance Constraints
- Response bodies are truncated to prevent large payloads from inflating memory footprint.
- Previews are sanitized to strip PII and authentication credentials before storing in the ring buffer.

## 4. AI Troubleshooting Prompt Generator

### 4.1 Purpose
When a user encounters a playback desynchronization, missing voice, or network failure, the diagnostic panel provides an **"Export AI Diagnostic Prompt"** action.

### 4.2 Generated Prompt Format
```markdown
### Automated Diagnostic Report
- **App Version**: vX.Y.Z
- **Host**: Web Companion / Android Native Shell
- **Active Video ID**: <ID>
- **Selected Languages**: Source: <lang>, Target: <lang>
- **Playback Metrics**: Time: <seconds>, State: <playing/paused>
- **Recent Telemetry (Last 10 Events)**:
  [LOG] <timestamp> - <tag>: <message>
- **Network Request Preview**:
  - Request: <URL>
  - Status: 200 OK
  - Body Preview: "{"wireMagic":"pb..."
```
